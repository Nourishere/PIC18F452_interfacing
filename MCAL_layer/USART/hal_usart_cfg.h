/* The USART module can work in three different modes: 
 * asynchronous, master synchronous, and slave synchronous. 
 * The hardware for the transmitter and receiver is separated. 
 * In master synchronous mode, the clock is generated by the 
 * transmitter/receiver. In this mode, RC6 is the clock (CK) line 
 * while RC7 is the data line (DT).
 * The hardware allows 9th bit both to use as a data bit or as a parity bit.
 * Below are macros to choose the operating mode, the use of a 9th bit for data, and 
 * the use for the 9th bit for parity
